# Learning programming & Mental Model

(Title is a WIP, I'm thinking of something Road to Junior?)

So far the general idea/theme of this blog will be about learning programming from a relatively new/recent developer... And that the biggest revelation for me and some learning(s) that I want to reflect on:
(I will give context that I am studying comp-sci (basically) at Uni, for the last few years. etc.)



- developing a "mental model", i.e. the ability to visualise the data-structures/algos (DSA) has been one of the key factors in helping me grow. Rather than being bogged down worrying about syntax, the concepts (can I actually see/visualise what I'm doing)...

- The above point will lead into things like drawing/sketching etc. spending more time "planning" than trying to blindly solve a problem (thinking = good lol)

- Programming (at a very basic level) is a simple set of rules that can produce some seriously complex results (see Conway's game of life)

- The importance of 'lateral thinking' & communication skills (which is what this blog will hopefully help improve)... mention the fact that I studied ARTS alongside my engineering and that classes like intro to Philosophy was a great pre-intro to predicate logic for discrete mathematics...  

- Being afraid of "breaking things"... Trying things to see if they work and not freaking out if they don't (basically experimenting)... Discuss GIT and the importance of version control


Try and transition into discussing one of the few areas of tutorial hell I experienced:
1. Not knowing what to build
2. Indecision on what tools to use (it was hard to pick and discern between tools)
3. Hopping from language to language, getting only a very surface level understanding and not doing more meaningful work/projects.
4. Not struggling enough (no pain no gain) /comparing myself to others (where I am vs where they are etc.)...
