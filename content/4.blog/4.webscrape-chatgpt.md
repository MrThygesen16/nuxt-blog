# Using Python & ChatGPT to webscrape

2023/02/10
______

## First Attempt(s)

1. Tried to use more traditional web-scraping methods (e.g. Selenium etc.) --> realised this was an issue as the website required you to scroll to load more data on attendees (infinite scroll)
2. Thought about using OpenCV to take screenshots and parse; I did this in a previous project; however, the scrolling issue stopped me dead in my tracks

After enough googling/inspecting elements etc. figured out that the website was calling an API each time I scrolled down, and that's how more people were being loaded in... About 20 per page. 

As it turns out there were roughly 175 pages. Doing a bit of basic maths we get:
```
175 * 20 = 3500
```

So all in all, there are about ~3,500 on this list alone. It would take tens, if not hundreds of hours to scroll through each page. and collect this info. What a waste of time that would be...

> Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it


### Steps:
- Go into inspect (on chrome)
- Network Tab
- Scroll down/click load more
- Click the second request:
```
https://api-prod.grip.events/1/container/5062/search?search=&sort=name&order=asc&type_id=5716,5718,5714,5717&page=2
```
- Look at the general headers:
Go into the preview section:
```js
{success: true, } data: [
    {id: 7311283, application_id: 743, name: "Abbi Failla", first_name: "Abbi", last_name: "Failla",},
    {id: 7351156, application_id: 743, name: "Abby DuLac ", first_name: "Abby ",},
    {id: 7381669, application_id: 743, name: "Abby Rogers", first_name: "Abby", last_name: "Rogers",},
    {id: 7311328, application_id: 743, name: "Abdo Bridi", first_name: "Abdo", last_name: "Bridi",},
    {id: 7380088, application_id: 743, name: "Abdul Bari Ahmadzai", first_name: "Abdul Bari",},
    {id: 6027759, application_id: 743, name: "Abhijit Ganguly", first_name: "Abhijit ",},
    {id: 7322530, application_id: 743, name: "Abhijit Joshi", first_name: "Abhijit", last_name: "Joshi",},
    {id: 7343896, application_id: 743, name: "Abhinav Warrier", first_name: "Abhinav",},
    {id: 6027962, application_id: 743, name: "Abhishek Katyal", first_name: "Abhishek ",},
    {id: 7260973, application_id: 743, name: "Abhishek Kapur", first_name: "Abhishek", last_name: "Kapur",},
    {id: 7262137, application_id: 743, name: "Abraham Lin ", first_name: "Abraham ",},
    {id: 7481091, application_id: 743, name: "Abraham Adamour", first_name: "Abraham",},
    {id: 7337961, application_id: 743, name: "Aby Lijtszain", first_name: "Aby", last_name: "Lijtszain",},
    {id: 6027741, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Jeevunjee ", first_name: "Adam ",},
    {id: 7347401, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Jensen", first_name: "Adam ", last_name: "Jensen",},
    {id: 7423058, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Gough ", first_name: "Adam ", last_name: "Gough ",},
    {id: 7414089, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Harrington ", first_name: "Adam ",},
    {id: 7417349, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Angell ", first_name: "Adam", last_name: "Angell ",},
    {id: 7428706, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Annen", first_name: "Adam", last_name: "Annen",},
    {id: 7415869, application_id: 743, name: "Adam Bryant", first_name: "Adam", last_name: "Bryant",}]
```

Perfect, we found what we were looking for! This is one request of many. 

I (naively) tried entering this API URL into my web browser, only to be greeted with the message:
```js
{"error":"missing authorization header"}
```

Hmmm. Still no luck.

I thought to myself, this would be a perfect time to try ChatGPT... Surely it might be of use?

## ChatGPT

I have never used ChatGPT before this, so I was keen to see its capabilities first-hand. I decided to jump straight into it and ask it to assist me with this task...


#### Prompt
```
Write a powershell script to query and retrieve the data from this api: https://api-prod.grip.events/1/container/5062/search?search=&sort=name&order=asc&type_id=5716,5718,5714,5717&page=4
```

#### Response
```perl
$url = "https://api-prod.grip.events/1/container/5062/search?search=&sort=name&order=asc&type_id=5716,5718,5714,5717&page=4"
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url
$data = $response.data

foreach ($item in $data) {
    Write-Host "Name: $($item.name)"
}
```

It gave me a script in what appears to be pearl (that's what the ChatGPT syntax highlighting said). I should have been a bit more specific.

_____

#### Prompt
```
When trying to access a website I get the error message: {"error":"missing authorization header"} what does this mean and how can I get around this?
```

#### Response
```
Unfortunately, this did not work either. Again, in retrospect, more specificity (i.e. what tools & languages) would have been a good start.
```
____

#### Prompt
```
How can I see the authorization token on a website I am visiting
```

#### Response
```
You can view the authorization token for a website you're visiting in the developer tools of your web browser. Here's how you can do this in Google Chrome:

1.  Right-click on the page and select "Inspect"
2.  In the developer tools window that opens, switch to the "Network" tab
3.  Refresh the page you're visiting
4.  Look for the API request you're interested in, and click on it to view its details
5.  Switch to the "Headers" tab, and look for the "Authorization" header

Note that some websites may encode the token, and it may not be immediately readable in its raw form. Additionally, not all websites will include the authorization token in the request header, as it may be stored elsewhere or passed as part of the URL or as a cookie.
```

To my surprise, this worked exactly how I wanted it to. I was able to see the field `x-authorization` with no issues.

This was my first little 'win' with ChatGPT.


Below is what the `x-authorization` looks like:

```
Headers:
x-authorization: d42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960
```

This appears to be submitted to the API - as some sort of form of authentication. I'm speculating that the browser stores this info, and then will get attached to the HTTPS request (in the header), and that allows the browser to load the queried data from this API.

I needed an easy way to query this. I was still having issues with curl, unfortunately.

One of my coworkers recommended that I use PostMan for testing this. It worked really well - I just plugged in the following values:
```
https://api-prod.grip.events/1/container/5062/search?search=&sort=name&order=asc&type_id=5716,5718,5714,5717&page=10

Headers:
x-authorization: ad42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960
```

And to my surprise -- it worked.

The response received is below:
```js

            "default_access": "in_person"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Great. So now we can request data from this API whilst not even being on the site. This was a major turning point in this little exercise. Querying this API via postman to get page after page of JSON would be faster than scrolling through the site, yet still quite slow...

Let's see if ChatGPT can generate a script/command to automate this process...


#### Prompt
```
How to curl an api url with a parameter for `x-authorization`
```
#### Response
```
The curl command to access an API endpoint with a header parameter `x-authorization` would be:
```
```less
curl -H "x-authorization: [value]" [API endpoint URL]
```
```
Replace `[value]` with the actual value for the `x-authorization` header and `[API endpoint URL]` with the actual URL of the API endpoint you want to access.
```

This seemed certain to work. Unfortunately... this was not the case.

______

#### Prompt
```
When running the code above I get the error: `Invoke-WebRequest : Cannot bind parameter 'Headers'. Cannot convert the "x-authorization:ad42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960" value of type "System.String" to type "System.Collections.IDictionary".` How can I fix this
```

#### Response
```
The error message is indicating that the `-Headers` parameter of the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet in PowerShell requires a hashtable (dictionary) as its value, not a simple string. To correct the error, you can create a hashtable that contains your header key-value pair and pass that as the value of the `-Headers` parameter:
```
```bash
$headers = @{ "x-authorization" = "ad42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960" }
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri [API endpoint URL] -Method GET -Headers $headers
```
```
Replace `[API endpoint URL]` with the actual URL of the API endpoint you want to access.
```

This command ended up working perfectly. I could not describe how happy and impressed I was that I had even got this far. I definitely could have Googled this, but honestly, this is far more convenient.

______

#### Prompt
```
How can I rewrite this script in python
```

#### Response
```
In Python, you can make a GET request to an API endpoint with a header using the `requests` library. Here's an example script to do that:
```
```python
import requests

url = '[API endpoint URL]'
headers = {'x-authorization': 'ad42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960'}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.content)
```
```
Replace `[API endpoint URL]` with the actual URL of the API endpoint you want to access. The `requests.get` method sends a GET request to the specified URL, and the `headers` argument is used to pass the headers as a dictionary. The `response` object returned by the `requests.get` method contains the response content, which can be accessed using the `content` attribute. In the example above, the content is printed to the console.
```

This python code is essentially the basis for the rest of the project.

parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)

if parsed_data['success']:
    data = parsed_data['data']
    for item in data:

        print('Job Title:', item['job_title'])
        print('Company Name:', item['company_name'])
        print('Location:',
```

Good thing to note is that whilst this was super convenient - make sure to NEVER input personal data into ChatGPT...
_____

#### Prompt
``` 
rewrite the following code to write the data to a csv file, rather than print to console: parsed_data = json.loads(response) if parsed_data['success']: data = parsed_data['data'] for item in data: print("-----------------") print('ID:', item['id']) print('Name:', item['name']) print('Headline:', item['headline']) print('Summary:', item['summary']) print('Job Title:', item['job_title']) print('Company Name:', item['company_name']) print('Job Industry:', item['job_industry']) print('Location:', item['location'])

#### Response
```python
import csv
import json

parsed_data = json.loads(response)

if parsed_data['success']:
    data = parsed_data['data']
    with open('data.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([
            'ID', 
            'Name', 
            'Headline', 
            'Summary', 
            'Job Title', 
            'Company Name', 
            'Job Industry', 
            'Location'

                item['headline'], 
                item['summary'], 
                item['job_title'], 
                item['company_name'], 
                item['job_industry'], 
                item['location']
            ])
```

The above code ends up running quite slowly. After a bit of refactoring, tweaking, troubleshooting, and further consulting with ChatGPT it became quite a bit faster.

## Final Python Script

Requirements
```
pip install requests
```

Below is the final Python script.

```python
# scrape.py

import requests
import json
import csv

  
def start() -> None:
    # use to construct address for API
    base_url = 'https://api-prod.grip.events/1/container/5062/search?search=&sort=name&order=asc&type_id=5716,5718,5714,5717&page='

    # there is about 175 pages total
    for i in range(1, 5):
        # API Destination to query
        url = base_url+str(i)

        # authentication token for above API
        headers = {'x-authorization': 'ad42cdd6-6592-448d-a2ca-c315808c2960'}
        print(url)

        # get request, process, and parse into json
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response = response.text
        parsed_data = json.loads(response)

        # writing to csv file
        if parsed_data['success']:
            data = parsed_data['data']
            with open('output.csv', mode='a', newline='', encoding='utf-8-sig') as file:
                writer = csv.writer(file)
                for item in data:
                    # Display data as it's being written
                    print("-----------------")
                    print('Name:', item['name'])
                    print('Company Name:', item['company_name'])
                    print('Job Title:', item['job_title'])
                    print('Location:', item['location'])

                    # Sanitize and write data to csv file using the JSON keys
                    row = [
                        sanitize(item['name']),
                        sanitize(item['company_name']),
                        sanitize(item['job_title']),
                        sanitize(item['location'])
                    ]
                    writer.writerow(row)

# function that handles corrupted strings/characters during fetch process
def sanitize(s) -> str:
    try:
        s = s.encode('utf-8', 'ignore').decode('utf-8-sig')
    except:
        return ' '
    return ''.join(c for c in s if ord(c) >= 32)

  

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start()
```


### Result:

Below is a small sample of the 3000+ row Excel/CSV file (took a few minutes to run the script in full).
