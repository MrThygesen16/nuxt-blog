# About

My name is Mike. I Graduated from Macquarie University with a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Technology. 

I'd consider Python and Java as the programming languges I feel most proficient with. 

That being said, through my University studies, internships, and personal projects I have had experience/exposure to: 
- Rust
- Scala 
- SQL 
- C
- Bash
- JavaScript/TypeScript 
- PowerShell
- Terraform 


Outside of university and programming, I enjoy playing guitar (electric and acoustic). I was in the band 'Day Release', with my two brothers. We formed the band during isolation in 2019. I took a step back from the band to focus on my studies. 

Still always practicing though!
